         <h2>HTML Basic Tags:</h2>
          <h4>DOCTYPE! html:</h4> 
          A doctype or document type declaration is an instruction that tells the web browser about the markup language in which the current page is written. It is not an element or tag. The doctype declaration is not case-sensitive.
          <h4>html:</h4> 
          This tag is used to define the root element of HTML document. This tag tells the browser that it is an HTML document. It is the second outer container element that contains all other elements within it.
          <h4>head:</h4>
          This tag is used to define the head portion of the HTML document that contains information related to the document. Elements within the head tag are not visible on the front-end of a webpage.
          <h4>body:</h4>
           The body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body content is what the browser will show on the front end.
          <h4>HTML Break:</h4>
           These tags are used for inserting a single line type break. It does not have any closing tag. In HTML the break tag is written as <br>. 
           <h4>HTML paragraph:</h4>
           These tags help us to write paragraph statements on a webpage. They start with the <p> tag and ends with </p>.
